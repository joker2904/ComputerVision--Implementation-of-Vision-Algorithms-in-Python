Notes :

For task1, we have implemented using numpy broadcasting ( for the bonus 1 marks )
The original dataset, its mean and then aligned dataset and its mean are vizualized, after implememntation of the algorithm.

For tasks 2 and 3, we have used numpy broadcasting.
The PCA is vizualized with various weight deviations.
The test set is vizualized, and then it is reconstructed from the PCA and then vizualized ( inference )
