# ComputerVision1 - Implementations of basic algorithms

If you run through the files, you can find basic implementations of algorithms like RANSAC, EM ( background segmentation ) ,
Particle Filter, Kalman Filter, and others. Implementations are done in python and numpy is used extensively. 

Also, the questions ( problem statements ) are given along with each problem.
